In Python, you can use the `print()` function to display information on the console or in the output window. Here's an example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

This will output the text "Hello, world!" to the console. You can pass different objects to the `print()` function, including strings, numbers, variables, and expressions. For example:

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
```

In this case, the output will be "My name is John and I am 25 years old." Note that the `print()` function automatically adds a space between the objects passed as arguments.

You can also format your output using the string formatting method. Here's an example using f-strings (formatted string literals):

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

This will produce the same output as the previous example.
